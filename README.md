# Automatic installation script for Windows

Installation script for my personal apps on a windows system. Feel free to use and modify it depending on your needs.

## Requirements

-   OS: Windows 10 (or above)

### How to run

-   Open a terminal with administrator privileges
-   Navigate to `install.bat` file location

_\*You may need to accept some UAC pop-ups on individual installation processes._
