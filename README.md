# Automatic installation script for Windows

**This project is no longer actively developed. I recommend you to use the improved [WinPostInstaller](https://github.com/dan-koller/WinPostInstaller).**

Installation script for my personal apps on a windows system. Feel free to use and modify it depending on your needs.

## Requirements

- OS: Windows 10 (or above)
- `winget` must be installed. Download msixbundle [here](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/releases)

### How to run

- Open a terminal with administrator privileges
- Navigate to `install.bat` file location
- Run the file
- Wait\* :)

_\*You may need to accept some UAC pop-ups on individual installation processes._
